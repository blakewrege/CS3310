CS3310 - Kaminski - Asgn 5 demo specs


Use Option A or Option B for the controller to
   run SetupUtility & DrivingApp
      (which are either programs or procedural classes)
   so either YOU (as human) or a Main program must:

1) run SetupUtility (specify Europe) which 
    - creates EuopeRoads.bin file
    - creates EuropeCityNames.txt file
    - pretty-prints both files to TheLog.txt file
2) run DrivingApp (specify Europe) which
    - processes EuropeCityPairs file
    - printing answers, traces, ... to TheLog
3) run SetupUtility (specify Other) which . . .
4) run DrivingApp (specify Other) which. . .


use a HexEditor to print out both
    - EuropeRoads.bin file

PACKET TO HAND IN - IN THIS ORDER
   - cover page
   - TheLog.txt
   - HexEdit printout of EuropeRoads.bin
   - Main program code file (if any)
   - SetUpUtility code file
   - DrivingApp code file
   - Map class code file
   - ShortestPath class code file
   - UI class code file
   - any other code files

NOTES ON READABILITY:  

When printing TheLog.txt (in Word or WordPad...)
- use Courier New (or other fixed-width font) so that
  the pretty-printed Matrix comes out "nice" and aligned
- use landscape & a smallish font & smaller margins
  to avoid wrap-around for the Matrix and have LESS 
  wrap-around for the Path and TraceOfTargets
- use line wrap-around (vs. line-truncation) so the whole
  Path and TraceOfTargets is visible

Make sure that:

- the graph is implemented as an EXTERNAL Adjacency MATRIX
  (NOT INTERNAL, for DrivingApp)
- you're using the ?Roads.bin file and NOT the ?MapData.txt
  file for DrivingApp
- the implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm is the one that I
    discussed in class (and that's on the course webpage)
- you have the right answers (as far as you can tell):
	- check if they seem REASONABLE,
	- make sure there aren't duplicates in path or trace,
	- make sure trace's order of cities follows "what you
		know Dijkstra's Algorithm should do"
- the answer path:
    - prints from START to DESTINATION (not DESTINATION to START)
    - uses city NAMES. not city NUMBERS
- the trace of targets shows the cities in the order that they
    were selected as targets (Do NOT use Included array to print
    target nodes in alphabetical order).
- you follow the specs for the TheLog format
