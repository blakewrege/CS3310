A6 Demo Specs

1) RE-Create a NEW version of the World DB in MySQL
   (since you've DELETEd/INSERTed/UPDATEd some
   of the data in the tables during your testing).
   [simplest option:  run WorldDriver (without City...)
    OR, keep the created TABLES, but just 
        DELETE all the data in the 2 tables
        and run the 2 INSERT script files for country
            and language DATA]


2) run your PROGRAM using the WorldTrans.txt file
   which creates a Log.txt

3) hand in:
   a)  the Log.txt (printed in smaller font & landscape,
        as needed so there's no/minimal wrap-around)
   b)  your program code
	(which is in 2+ physically separate files:
	   UserApp & DBHandler
	(and any other code files you wrote)


I do NOT need to see anything which you did manually 
(i.e., setting up the DB and its data)
NOR anything that MY SCRIPT (COMMAND) files do in
the MySQL command window.  The Log file will give me
what I need to know with all those SELECT statements.

CAUTION:
 No hard-coding (like my Demo Program did) in your code of
   - SQL queries themselves
   - header-line column labels
     (Either DON'T USE ANY HEADINGS or get them from the DBS)
