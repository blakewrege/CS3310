% TransData2a.txt file for Asgn 2 - just test A and S transactions

% For showAll (A) requests, note that the data in the file ARE in
%    physical order by id - so use SEQUENTIAL ACCESS rather than
%    RANDOM ACCESS.  However, you'll need a single seek at the
%    start of showAll method since a prior transaction moved the
%    file position ptr to somewhere other than byte 0
