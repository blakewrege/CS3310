CS3310 - Kaminski - Asgn 6 demo specs

0) delete Log.txt & MapDataPrintout.txt
1) run Setup
2) run PrettyPrint
3) run DrivingApp
4) printout MapDataPrintout.txt
   USE courier font (or some other nice fixed-width font),
         	smallish font, smallish margins, landscape
   	AS NEEDED to avoid wrap-around for MapDataPrintout's bigGraph
	and so the bigGraph fits on 1 page
5) printout Log.txt
   USE courier font (or some other nice fixed-width font),
        	smallish font, smallish margins, landscape,
   	& 2-sided printing
   	AS NEEDED to reduce paper-usage
   USE line wrap-around (NOT line-truncation) so the whole
	Path & TraceOfTargets is visible
6) printout MapGraph.bin file using a HexEditor

PACKET TO HAND IN - IN THIS ORDER
   - cover page
   - MapDataPrintout.txt (which shows the 2 map data files)
   - HexEdit printout of MapGraph.bin
   - Log.txt
   - Setup program code file
   - PrettyPrint program code file
   - DrivingApp program code file
   - Map class code file
   - Route class code file
   - UI class code file
   - any other code files

Make sure that:

- MapGraph is implemented as an
	EXTERNAL file
	BINARY file
	TRIANGULAR Adjacency MATRIX
	LOWER LEFT triangle
- DrivingApp uses the MapGraph.bin file and CityNameList.csv
    and NOT the original RAW data file for Europe
- the implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm is the one that I
    discussed in class
- map.getRoadDistance returns 1 of THREE possible types of short
    integer value:  0, "infinity", actual roadDistance
- you have the right answers (as far as you can tell):
	- check if they seem REASONABLE
	- make sure there aren't duplicates in path or trace
	- make sure trace's order of cities follows "what you
		know Dijkstra's Algorithm should do"
- answer path:
    - prints from START to DESTINATION (not DESTINATION to START)
    - uses city NAMES (not city NUMBERS or city CODES)
- trace of targets shows the cities in the order that they were
    selected as targets (Do NOT use Included array to print
    target nodes in alphabetical order after the fact).
- trace of targets shows city CODES
- you follow the specs's format the output data files
