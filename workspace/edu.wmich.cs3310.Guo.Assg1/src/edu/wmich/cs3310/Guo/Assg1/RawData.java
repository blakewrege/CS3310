//CLASS: RawData - Used by Setup program
//AUTHOR: Jia Guo
//DESCRIPTION: This is the input file for Setup program. The functions of this class includes: 
//		open file in public constructor, close file in public finishUp method, a single record read 
//		in by input1Country public method; record split into individual fields by private cleanup and setter methods
//		individual field data available to Setup by public getter methods; only a SINGLE record (and a single set of fields) 
//		is needed within the class since a NEW record can over-write the prior recordâ€™s data, since the prior record is already 
//		completely handled
//Regarding any other issues, please feel free to contact me via email: jia.guo@wmich.edu
